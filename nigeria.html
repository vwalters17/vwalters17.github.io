        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Through pre-colonial times, the area of Nigeria was made up of many ethnic groups that had different languages and traditions. The United Kingdom colonized Nigeria and this created British influence.</p>

        <p>After World War II, Nigeria gained its independence from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on October 1, 1960, the country was mostly under military rule. After the death of a military head of state in <time datetime="1998">1998</time>, there was a political transition.</p>

        <p>The following year, a new constitution was written, and the country transitioned to a civilian government. The government continued working on institutionalizing democracy and rebuilding the economy, which is heavily reliant on petroleum.</p>

        <p>Currently, Nigeria is experiencing its longest civilian ruled government. In their latest election in <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, there were still issues of voting irregularities, intimidation, and violence. There is still a lot of tension between ethnic and religious groups.</p>
