      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>Hello! My name is Victoria Walters. I was born on November 17, 1998 to Edward and Dana Walters in Frederick, Maryland. I was an only-child for 17 years, but my parents ended up adoptinig my brother, Zach, who is now 5 years old.</p>

      <p>In <time datetime="2007">2007</time> my family relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after my dad accepted a new job. I attended an all-girls school, Springside Chestnut Hill Academy, from 3rd grade until graduation. My favorite subject in school was science, and I played on the tennis and lacrosse teams both in and out of school.</p>

      <p>After graduating high school I decided to attend the University of Miami and study Entrepreneurship. I ended up changing my major and am now majoring in Economics and minoring in Finance.</p>

      <p>I am currently a senior and will be graudating from Miami in Spring <time datetime="2021">2021</time>. Post graduation, I will be returning to <abbr title="Philadelphia">Philly</abbr> and will work as a financial analyst at Lincoln Financial.</p>
