        <h3>My Sports Background</h3>
        <p>I have always had an interest in sports. When I was younger I tried every sport from squash to gymnastics. When I was in the 3rd grade I started playing lacrosse and ended up playing in and out of school until highschool.</p>
        <p>When I was in 7th grade I realized I had a love for tennis and started shifting the amount of time spent playing lacrosse to attending tennis lessons and clinics. I ended up playing tennis throughout highschool.</p>
        <p>Although I am no longer playing competitively, I still enjoy staying active by going to the gym, attending workout classs, or occasionally playing tennis with frieinds. </p>

        <h3>High School Tennis</h3>
        <p>When I got into high school, my love for tennis had grown. I was constantly training both on the courts and at the gym in preparation for tryouts. When tryouts came along, I ended up making it onto thee varsity team, being only 1 of 2 freshmen to make it.</p>
        <p>Each year I got better and moved up the ladder. I was now thinking of either taking a year off to play before attending college or playing at a school. Sadly, this changed after I tore a ligament in my wrist taking me most of my junior year.</p>
        <p>Dealiing with that injury  only pushed me to do the best I could do. As soon as I was cleared to play, I was back on the courts. My senior year I not only became captain of the team, but also was playinig in the #1 position.</p>

        <h3>Victoria's Acers</h3>
        <p>My love for tennis was not only for playing, but for coaching. I started off helping out at my country club coaching the younger kids. By the next summer I was a junior instructor and I did this for all of my highschool summers.</p>
        <p>After discussing with my parents, we decided it was a good idea for me to try and create a program where I was able to do what I loved, which was coach tennis.</p>
        <p>Victoria's Acers was created. I woorked in the city of Philadelphia partnering with a school. I came and taught children and they loved it. Later I received an award for my non-profit.</p>
